# BrainTrain_3000
A small electronics project making games with addressable LEDs. Demo video here: https://youtu.be/QzLPgpyOv5U?si=5WpWh86AH3XESVQT

STL files and ardunio code included. This was a learnign project so the code isn't pretty, but it works! There are 3 modes:
  1. Demo/Intro
  2. 'Rhythm' game: Click the joystick button when all 10 LEDs are showing
  3. 'Memory' game: Copy the sequence shown using the joystick
